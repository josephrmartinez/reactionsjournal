General:
- figure out 100% height issue with browser url bar.
- design: change background color to slightly off white


Concepts:
- design: move header toggle down? also move logs down? same start point as addentry headers?
- design: how to make grid words look clickable?
- design: change color for selected text in toggle. softer dark gray
- design: better design for popup infobox
- design/code: implement slideshow click functionality on infobox popups. nav to next item with arrows


Logs:
- ON LOG COMPONENT: render "notes". Will need header as well


Insights:
- design: conditionally render prompt to keep adding logs when logs < 5
- code: implement check for n logs.
- design / code: conditionally render component with insights if n logs > 5


Account:
- conditionally render prompt based on whether there is any custom data actually in localstorage


Add:
- bug fix: text input on location field is too wide; causes browser to scroll to the right
